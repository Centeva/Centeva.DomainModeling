# Upgrading to 8.0

## Breaking Changes

* The `IEntityWithEvents` interface has been removed and replaced with an
  abstract base class `ObjectWithEvents`, which lets us reduce method
  accessibility for working with domain events.
* `IDomainEventDispatcher.DispatchAndClearEvents` now takes
  `IEnumerable<ObjectWithEvents>` as its parameter.
* It is no longer possible to clear domain events from outside the
  project containing your entities.
* It is no longer possible to remove a single domain event registered on an
  entity.
* `BaseDomainEvent`.`Occurred` has been renamed to `DateOccurred` to reduce
  confusion about its datatype, which is now `DateTime` as we do not need
  offset information when working with UTC.
