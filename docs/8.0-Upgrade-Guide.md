# Upgrading to 8.0

## Domain Event Changes

The Domain Event implementation has been adjusted to tighten up the ways in
which developers can work with them.  

* It is no longer possible to add a domain event to an entity from outside an
  instance of that entity.  
* It is no longer possible to remove domain events (one or all) from an entity
  from outside the project containing your entities.
* In order to implement the above and still have a working
  `IDomainEventDispatcher`, the `IEntityWithEvents` interface has been replaced
  with an abstract base class `ObjectWithEvents` from which `BaseEntity`
  inherits.  `IDomainEventDispatcher.DispatchAndClearEvents` now takes
  `IEnumerable<ObjectWithEvents>` as its parameter.

`BaseDomainEvent`.`Occurred` has been renamed to `DateOccurred` to reduce
confusion about its datatype, which is now `DateTime` as we do not need
offset information when working with UTC.

`DomainEventDispatcher` has been renamed to `MediatRDomainEventDispatcher` to
improve clarity about its purpose.  You will need to update your Dependency
Injection configuration to use the new name.
