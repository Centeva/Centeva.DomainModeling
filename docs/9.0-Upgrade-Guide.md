# Upgrading to 9.0

## Breaking Changes

### Improved Repository Extensibility

Sometimes your project needs to add additional methods to the Repository
implementation.  In honor of the Open/Closed Principle, we have made this easier
to do in a couple of ways:

1. The `IRepository<T>` and `IReadRepository<T>` interfaces have been renamed to
   `IBaseRepository<T>` and `IBaseReadRepository<T>` respectively.  This allows
   you to create your own `IRepository` and `IReadRepository` interfaces that
   inherit from the base interfaces and add your own methods.  You can then
   create your own `Repository` implementation in your project that inherits
   from the `BaseRepository` abstract class and implements your custom
   interfaces.

2. The `_dbContext` property of the `BaseRepository` class has been changed from
   `private` to `protected` to allow you to access it from your own inherited
   implementations.  You are cautioned to avoid exposing `DbContext` and
   `IQueryable` to application code.

### Removal of AutoMapper project support

The Centeva.DomainModeling.EFCore.AutoMapper package has been removed, as we no
longer encourage use of AutoMapper on our projects.  You can easily make your
own by extending the base interfaces and implementation if needed.
