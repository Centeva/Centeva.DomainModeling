# Upgrading to 3.0

## Repository

The `bool saveChanges` parameter (defaulting to `true`) was
removed from the methods defined in `IRepository`.  If your calling code was
passing `true` or using the default value, then you nothing needs to change.  If
you were passing `false` then you need to remove this parameter from the calling
code.

### Reason for Change

This was previously added to allow consumers to batch up changes before
persisting.  It has been removed to promote best practices - if someone needs it
the interface can be extended within that project.

Best practice is to only add/remove one Aggregate per request/action.  By
removing batching from the `AddAsync` method we can better enforce that
practice.

### Alternate Methods

All entities retrieved from persistent storage will be tracked by Entity
Framework Core.  As a result, you can make needed changes, then call the
`SaveChangesAsync` method of your repository.  All changed entities will be
persisted at that time.
