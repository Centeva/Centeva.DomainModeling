# Upgrading to 10.0

This guide includes changes from 9.0, which was never released due to some
issues found after tagging.

## Breaking Changes

### Namespace Consolidation

All of the interfaces and classes in the `Centeva.DomainModeling` package now
reside in the `Centeva.DomainModeling` namespace.  This means that you will need
to update your `using` statements to reflect this change.

### Improved Repository Extensibility

Sometimes your project needs to override the default behavior of the Repository
implementation.

The `_dbContext` property of the `BaseRepository` class has been changed from
`private` to `protected` to allow you to access it from your own inherited
implementations.  You are cautioned to avoid exposing `DbContext` and
`IQueryable` to application code.

### Removal of AutoMapper project support

The Centeva.DomainModeling.EFCore.AutoMapper package has been removed, as we no
longer encourage use of AutoMapper on our projects.  You can easily make your
own by extending the base interfaces and implementation if needed.
